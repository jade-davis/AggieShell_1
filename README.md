This is the Aggie Shell code from my resume. All my code I wrote is in shell.cpp.

I designed my own Linux shell in c++ that lets a user navigate through the file system and performs multiple tasks using simple commands. It also offers capabilities of interprocess communication and file input/out redirection. Each Linux command (e.g., cat, echo, cd, etc.) runs as a child process.
